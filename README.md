## Description
 - What we covered today consisted of setting up basic components (button, counter, header, and footer) using next.js, creating module.css and index.js for them, importing them into the main page with styling. 
 - We also created cross-page linking between home and about pages.
 - With buttons, we dealt with integrating useStates into our components (mainly incrementing, decrementing, arrays, and pointer).
